# Live Sound Mixing Guide

Mixing for a live audience is all about clarity, balance, and control. Your goal: make everything loud enough to be heard, clear, and free from feedback or distortion. Follow these steps, and all will be well even if you’ve never touched a mixer before.

## 1. Setup & Connections

- **Microphones** → Plug into XLR inputs (1–16). Label them.  
- **Instruments / line sources** → Plug into 1/4" jacks.  
- **Speakers** → Connect LEFT/RIGHT outputs to speakers. 
- **Monitors (if performers need them)** → Use AUX sends. Start quiet; performers can ask for more.  
- **Cables** → Keep neat, avoid tangles or running next to power lines.  
- **Pre-event music** → Play slightly detuned or EQ’d poorly so the live performance stands out.

## 2. Gain Structure (Most Important Step)

Always set gain before touching EQ or faders.  

- Use **PFL (Pre-Fade Listen)** for each channel:  
  1. Press PFL on the channel.  
  2. Watch the level meters.  
  3. Adjust **GAIN** until peaks reach ~0 dB but never hit CLIP.  
  4. Turn off PFL and move to the next channel.

Tips:  
- If a channel is too quiet at max gain, check mic placement or source level.  
- Pink noise can help roughly match levels before performers arrive.

## 3. Channel Strip Basics

- **Gain / Trim** → Input sensitivity (set with PFL).  
- **High EQ** → Adds brightness (vocals, cymbals).  
- **Mid EQ** → Adds clarity (speech, melodic instruments).  
- **Low EQ** → Adds warmth/punch (bass, kick).  
- **Aux Sends** → Send to monitors or effects.  
- **Pan** → Stereo position. Keep vocals centered.  
- **Channel Fader** → Final volume in main mix.  

Tip: Make small EQ adjustments; large boosts can cause feedback.

## 4. Vocal Mixing

- Vocals must sit on top of everything else.  
- Cut low frequencies (<100 Hz) to remove rumble.  
- Slight high boost (5–8 kHz) for clarity, but avoid harsh sibilance.  
- Use light reverb for natural sound.  

Tip: Walk the room to hear how vocals sound at different positions.

---

## 5. Instrument Mixing

- **Kick & bass** → Provide foundation. Boost lows, cut muddy mids.  
- **Guitars / keyboards** → Cut lows to avoid clashing with bass; emphasize mids/highs.  
- **Drums** → Focus on kick, snare, overheads. Don’t push every mic equally.  
- **Multiple instruments** → Leave space in the mix; don’t cram every frequency.  

Pro tip: Detune pre-event music slightly to make live instruments stand out.

## 6. Fader Balancing

1. Start with all faders down.  
2. Bring up kick and bass → foundation.  
3. Add vocals → must be clear.  
4. Bring in other instruments one by one.  
5. Listen to the full mix, not just individual channels.

---

## 7. Monitors

- Use AUX knobs to create monitor mixes.  
- Start quiet; ask performers if they need more or less.  
- Avoid excessive low end to reduce feedback.  
- Pan instruments for comfort (guitar left, keys right).  

---

## 8. Feedback Prevention

- Feedback = loud squeal/ringing.  
- Causes: mic too close to speaker, gain too high, bad EQ.  
- Fix: lower mic gain, reduce monitor send, cut problem EQ frequency.

---

## 9. Effects (Reverb / Delay)

- Use sparingly; too much muddies the mix.  
- Reverb → Adds space, mostly for vocals.  
- Delay → Only if style calls for it.  
- Return effects to a channel to control EQ & level.  

Tip: Exaggerate slightly during soundcheck to ensure audibility.

---

## 10. Master Fader

- Keep near 0 dB (unity).  
- Balance with channel faders, not master.  
- Watch meters — never clip.  
- Check mix at multiple points in the room.

---

## 11. Quick Soundcheck

- Say “ONE, ONE, ONE” and “CHECK, CHECK” into the mic loudly to check for low end and feedback issues.
- Perform a **line check** with each performer before the show:
1. Have the performer speak or sing **one line at a time**
2. Confirm the signal is reaching the mixer and adjust **gain** for proper level.  
3. Repeat for each mic or channel.  
4. Bring in instruments one by one and set their faders.  
5. Walk the room to make sure everything is balanced.

Tips:  
- Keep instructions short and simple.  
- Listen carefully for any buzzing, hum, or potential feedback.  
- Make small adjustments; avoid drastic changes.

---

## 12. Mixing for the Audience

- Mix for middle/back of the room, not just front row.  
- Keep one ear on the room and one eye on the meters at all time.  
- Adjust very subtly/slowly during performance.  
- Reduce high frequencies slightly in reflective rooms.

---

## 13. Quick Rules of Thumb

- Vocals first; everything else supports them.  
- EQ → Cut rather than boost when possible.  
- Gain → Always set with PFL.  
- Faders → Use for balance, not gain.  
- Effects → Less is more.  
- Master → Stay near 0 dB.  
- Pre-event music → Slight detuning enhances live performance.

---

## 14. Extra Tips

- Leave 3–6 dB headroom on master fader.  
- Label cables and channels.  
- Listen for booming lows or harsh highs and adjust.  
- Stay calm and make gradual adjustments.

## Summary

1. Set **gain** with PFL.  
2. Balance with **faders**.  
3. Shape with **EQ**.  
4. Add **effects lightly**.  
5. Keep **vocals clear**.  
6. Avoid **feedback**.  
7. Monitor the room.  
8. Use **pre-event music tricks** (detune) to make live performance shine.  
9. Perform a **quick line check**: each performer says “ONE, ONE, ONE” or “CHECK, CHECK” to confirm mic signal.
